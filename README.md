# alpha_synuclein_conservation
Explorative analysis of the conservation of alpha-synuclein. Conservation is tracked through evolution via comparing orthologues from a variety of species to human alpha-synuclein. The variation of alpha-synuclein within humans is also analyzed by identifying and comparing protein altering variations from large genome sequencing projects.
